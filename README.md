# rc-files
Available on GitHub at [christian-taillon/rc-files](https://github.com/christian-taillon/rc-files) are the RC configurations I use for my Linux environments for some Quality of Life improvements. I primarily work out of Gnome Shell in a Debian 10 environment. My servers are all CentOS Stream. These RC files work well for both for me.

You're millage may vary.

As always, you should review any code/scripts/configuration you get from the internet.

I highly recommend checking out the [VIM Awesome list](https://github.com/akrawchyk/awesome-vim). <br>
I also recommend using [VIM-Plug pluggin manager](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

The [update-home.sh](https://github.com/christian-taillon/rc-files/blob/master/update-home.sh) is a simple script to automate copying over these rc files to my home directory. And sourcing them.

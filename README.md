# rc-files
Custom configurations I use for my Linux environments.
I primarily work out of Gnome Shell in a Debian 10 environment. My servers are all CentOS Stream.

I highly recommend checking out the [VIM Awesome list](https://github.com/akrawchyk/awesome-vim). <br>
I also recommend using [VIM-Plug pluggin manager](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug).

The [update-home.sh](https://github.com/christian-taillon/rc-files/blob/master/update-home.sh) is a simple script to automate copying over these rc files to my home directory. And sourcing them.

These are the non-private portions of the configurations I use. While nothing here should cause any problems and they have worked out of the box for me in several Linux distros, I would recommend reviewing the configurations and just using what you want.

## Dependencies
While I have tried to keep the public configs simple for others to use, I do use some `batcat` as an alternative to `cat`. I note this to prevent configuration. Your distro will likely have the other applications I use installed.
